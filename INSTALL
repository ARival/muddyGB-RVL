Installation Instructions

These instructions are for compiling boueux from source.
If the distribution that you recieved already contains the file boueux.gb,
use that file like you would any other GameBoy ROM image.

Dependencies
============

GBDK <http://gbdk.sourceforge.net/> is required to compile from source.
Make <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/> is also used.
